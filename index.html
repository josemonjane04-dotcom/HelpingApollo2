    <!-- ABOUT THE STORY -->
    <section class="container reveal">
      <h2>A True Story of Love and Hope</h2>
      <p>
        “Helping Apollo” is more than a story — it’s a mission of compassion. Apollo was found abandoned, shaking from the cold, weak, and nearly giving up. His eyes carried fear, pain, and a silent request for help.
      </p>
      <p>
        Taking care of Apollo has not been easy — he needs food, medical care, vaccines, comfort, and love. Every contribution supports his recovery and helps give him a second chance at life.

      <div class="chapter">
        <h3>Chapter 1 — The Discovery</h3>
        <p>It was a normal day when I found a small box on the sidewalk. Inside, a trembling puppy with no strength left. His hopeless eyes told me everything — I could not walk away.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="chapter">
        <h3>Chapter 2 — The Decision</h3>
        <p>Even without a stable life myself, I chose to take him home. I named him Apollo — a strong name for a beautiful new beginning.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="chapter">
        <h3>Chapter 3 — The Challenge</h3>
        <p>Caring for Apollo is an act of love, but also a challenge. He needs nutrition, medical care, and emotional healing. Every support received changes his life more than words can express.</p>
      </div>

      <p>Thank you for reading, supporting, and being part of Apollo’s journey. Apollo thanks you — with a wagging tail and a healing heart.</p>
